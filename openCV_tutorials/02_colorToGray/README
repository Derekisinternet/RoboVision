This script shows you how to open, modify and save images using OpenCV.

It takes a path to a jpeg file as an argument.

It then opens the file using imread(). 

Next, the script converts the color image to a grayscale using cvtColor().

Next, the script saves it in your current directory using imwrite(), and then displays both versions like we did in DisplayImage.

Then it waits for user to press the '0' (zero) key to exit.
